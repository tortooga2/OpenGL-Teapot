# OpenGL-Graphics-Engine

This is a very simple, kinda messy, implimentation of OpenGL with GLFW. It also has a very primative mesh loader that support .obj. It does not support multi-mesh files. by making an running the executable, you should see the utah teapot. You can also use arrow keys and wasd to move around the model.
